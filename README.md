This is a test / sample repo for the solace rag project. This repository contains a Python library template using cookiecutter for quick project scaffolding.

## Overview

The Python Library Template provides a standardized structure for creating Python libraries with best practices, including testing, linting, and documentation.

## Features

- üöÄ Quick project setup with cookiecutter
- üì¶ Modern Python packaging with setup.py
- üß™ Testing with pytest
- üîç Code quality tools (black, flake8, mypy)
- üìù Comprehensive documentation structure
- üîÑ Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- üìã MIT License (configurable)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda package manager
- cookiecutter (`pip install cookiecutter`)

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/vismathomas/test-doc-python.git
cd test-doc-python

# Create a new project using cookiecutter
cookiecutter .
```

### Basic Usage

After creating your project with cookiecutter, you'll have a fully structured Python library ready to customize.

```python
# Example usage of the generated library
from my_python_library import core

# Use the library functions
result = core.process_data(input_data)
print(result)
```
